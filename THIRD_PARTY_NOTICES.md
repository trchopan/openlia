Go module pins and transitive dependencies are declared in
[`go.mod`](go.mod) and [`go.sum`](go.sum). The Python dependency above is declared in
[`profile/skills/claim-review/requirements.txt`](profile/skills/claim-review/requirements.txt)
and is also used by the development requirements file.

## Container Base Images and Packages

The derived images use these pinned base images:

- Hermes image base: `nousresearch/hermes-agent:v2026.9.14` at the digest
  listed above.
- Locho image base: `debian:13.4-slim` at
  `sha256:109e2c65005bf160609e4ba6acf7783752f8502ad218e298253428690b9eaa4b`.

The Dockerfiles install distribution packages including `ca-certificates`,
`curl`, `git`, `hledger`, `passwd`, `tzdata`, `unzip`, and `xz-utils`. Optional
tool capabilities may also install Poppler, LibreOffice Writer and Calc
headless packages,
Tesseract OCR and English language data, FFmpeg, and yt-dlp. These packages and
their transitive dependencies have package-specific licenses and copyright
notices. The optional image build resolves Debian packages from the dated
`20260505T000000Z` snapshot configured in `docker/compose.yaml`, making package
resolution reproducible for that snapshot. For a built image, inspect the
package metadata and files under
`/usr/share/doc/*/copyright` and consult the distribution's license
information.

## Bundled and Transitive Notices

- Bun statically links or embeds additional libraries and polyfills with
  licenses including LGPL, BSD, Apache, MIT, zlib, and other licenses. Refer to
  Bun's upstream licensing information for the complete component inventory.
- Hermes Agent and Locho may include their own dependencies and notices inside
  their respective images or release archives. OpenLia does not replace those
  notices.
- The final image also contains dependencies supplied by the upstream Hermes
  image and the Debian base image. A complete notice set for a particular image
  must be generated from that image, including its package database and
  upstream-provided notice files.

When redistributing an OpenLia-built image, binary, or release archive, retain
the applicable upstream license texts and attribution notices from every
included artifact. Verify the current pins in the Dockerfiles and release
manifest before making a redistribution.

## Host Tools and External Services

Docker Engine, Docker Compose, Go, Python, Bash, SSH, GitHub, and configured
OpenAI-compatible providers are prerequisites or external services. They are
not bundled by this repository and remain subject to their own terms and
licenses. Optional Locho capabilities are also supplied and licensed by their
respective service or software providers.
